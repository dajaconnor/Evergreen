Follow these directions if you have a zip file from Backstage already.  
In the future, this will be updated to be able to import and export 
directly to Backstage.  

example of command to run:

	./BSLWimport.pl sample.json mod_bs.zip

	./BSLWimport.pl sample.json ~the zip file with the BIB.mrc and AUTH.mrc files~

Make sure you have your services running.
