This readme will tell you how to run the linking.  

First you must modify authority_control_fields_batcher.pl with your database information and the size
of the batches you wish to run.

Then you will run authority_control_fields_batcher.pl, which will create batches.  

	./authority_control_fields_batcher.pl > batches		

Then you will run disbatcher.pl, which will run through the batches.

	./disbatcher.pl -n 2 -f /home/kclsdev/24kcls_evergreen/linking/batches

	The options are -n for number to run, 
		-f is the batch file you created with authority_control_fields_batcher.pl
		-v is for verbose

The authority and bib records should now be linked.

Enjoy.
